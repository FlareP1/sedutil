sedutil is built using autotools and make.
steps:
autoreconf -i
./configure --enable-silent-rules
make
------------------------
This will also build the PBA ignore it.

If you get an error building that says Version.h is missing
you need to make all. This is an issue with how autotools handles
built sources and dependencies. 

To build the images then
cd images 
and read the BUILDING file


-----------------------
To set the build version change the following files:

configure.ac
images/buildroot/package/sedutil/sedutil.mk

git tag -a <VersionNum> -m "Version <VersionNum> release"
e.g. git tag -a 1.20.1 -m "Version 1.20.1 release"

after building use git push origin --tags to push the tags to the remote
